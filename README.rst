Numerical Methods for Physics
=============================

Repository of numerical methods with specific applications to classical, statistical and quantum physics.


Several notions about the computing methods we use in this repository can be found at: `CMPDA`_

.. _CMPDA: https://github.com/Dario-Maglio/CMPDA.git



Here you can find notes and codes about:

- application projects.

- basics of Fortran programming language and numerical methods (Basic methods).

- methods for roots, minimization and integration (Basic methods).

- methods for diagonalizing NxN matrices (Applications).

- methods for Ordinary, Stochastic and Partial Differential Equations.

- methods for Monte Carlo simulations and Pseudo Random Number Generators.



Materials come from different sources, but most are from the "Metodi Numerici" course at the University of Pisa and the "Fisica Computazionale" course at the University of Salerno. All sources are cited in the documentation and in the README file of each directory.
